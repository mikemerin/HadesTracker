# Hades Tracker

Main link here! https://hades-tracker.herokuapp.com/

Allows you to track which boons you've unlocked, including the main god boons, duos, Daedalus upgrades, and weapon aspects.

The primary mode, 'Boon Hunting', allows you to set boons as 'active' to match your current run, and shows you which boons are unlocked to use vs. those still needing to be unlocked in the boon tree. You can hover over any boon's active icon to show which boons unlock it along with what it unlocks.

You can also import/export the data in this app, or reset all data if you are starting fresh. Plenty more to come!
